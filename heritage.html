        National museum
The Botswana National Museum, also known as the National Museum and Art Gallery, is located in  Gaborone and is a multi-disciplinary institution that includes the National Art Gallery and Octagon Gallery, as well as—since November 2007—the National Botanical Garden. It displays traditional Botswana crafts and paintings and aims to celebrate the work of local artists.  The museum is also involved with the preservation of Tsodilo, the country's first world heritage area, among other efforts. It is the caretaker of Tsholofelo Park, the burial place of the "negro of Banyoles," known as "El Negro" in Botswana, following the body's return from the Darder Museum of Banyoles, in Spain

       MATSIENG FOOT PRINT
        Its a site known for its rock art, or petroglyphs, called the Matsieng Footprints. The site is littered with depressions, or holes, thought to have been formed as volcanic vents. They fill with rainwater, and are sometimes used by local peoples still today for water collection. There are two deeper cavities on the site; around the northeast one is where most of the rock art is found. 
       Most of the site is littered with carved footprints, both human and animal. The outlines of footprints were crafted by pecking, a form of engraving, by ancient peoples. On the site, there is evidence of LSA dated artifacts, but it is more likely that the engravings were created earlier by hunter-gatherers, perhaps by ancestors of the San or the Basarwa. Matsieng is located on a flat outcrop of sandstone. The area was used as a watering hole for herders’ livestock and many of the petroglyphs suffered from the heavy foot traffic until recently
